# xrandr_brightness_control_xps_15

A simple script to control the brightness of my XPS 15 screen using the hardware buttons. This script should be added as an endpoint for the custom shortcuts. Passing "up" to the script will increase screen brightness, passing "down" will decrease brightness. 

This script doesn't integrate with the KDE brightness scrollbar.
